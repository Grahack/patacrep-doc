\section{Setup}
\label{sec:install}
%*******************************************************************************

Globally, avoid naming files or directories with spaces or special
characters. In this guide, we consider that the working directory is:
\directory{\$HOME/songbook} which may also be referred to as
\directory{/home/user/songbook} or \directory{$\sim$/songbook}.

The \songbook relies on \latex to format a list of songs and on
\python to build indexes (required dependencies). 

Music sheets can be included if written with Lilypond.  Finally, a pdf
reader application is required to open produced songbooks (\ext{pdf}
files).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\linux}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Dependencies}

Install required dependencies.
\begin{unix}
  sudo apt-get install texlive-base texlive-latex-extra
  sudo apt-get install texlive-lang-french texlive-lang-italian texlive-lang-spanish texlive-lang-portuguese
  sudo apt-get install python
\end{unix}

Install recommended dependencies.
\begin{unix}
  sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended
  sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra
  sudo apt-get install lilypond
\end{unix}

\paragraph{Sources}

Sources can be retrieved as a \ext{tar.gz} archive
\begin{unix}
  wget http://www.patacrep.com/data/documents/songbook.tar.gz
  tar xzvf songbook.tar.gz
\end{unix}

or as a \git repository

\begin{unix}
  git clone git://git.lohrun.net/songbook.git
\end{unix}

\paragraph{Compile and run}

The compilation chain is automated through a \emph{makefile}. In your
songbook's directory:

\begin{unix}
  make all
\end{unix}

Some makefile's options:
\begin{itemize}
\item \command{\$ make clean}~: removes logs and temporary files
  produced during the compilation step, except \ext{pdf} files.
\item \command{\$ make cleanall}~: removes all temporary files and
  produced \ext{pdf}.
\item \command{\$ make lilypond}~: generates music sheets
  corresponding to Lilypond sources (\ext{ly} files) as \ext{pdf} in
  \directory{./lilypond}. The Lilypond software is required.
\item \command{\$ make archive}~: build a compressed archive
  \file{songbook.tar.gz} with the sources of the project.
\item \command{\$ make book.pdf}~: since \command{make} or
  \command{make all} may take some time, if you are only interested in a
  single songbook, you can specify the book (\ext{pdf}) you
  want. Instead of \file{book.pdf}, you may choose:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
    \hline
    \command{make} & description \\
    \hline
    \file{songbook\_en.pdf} &~: full version with the whole set of songs and music sheets \\
    \file{volume-$i$.pdf} &~: builds the volume $i$ (around 160 pages)\\
    \file{naheulbeuk.pdf} &~: a songbook for the \emph{Donjon de Naheulbeuk}\\
    \file{english.pdf} &~: english songs only\\
    \file{french.pdf} &~: french songs only\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that the \command{make} command without any option corresponds to
\command{make \file{songbook.pdf}}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\windows}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Dependencies}

Install required dependencies.
\begin{itemize}
\item Miktex~: \url{http://miktex.org/}
\item Python~: \url{http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/}
\end{itemize}

\begin{nota}
The compilation process under \windows has been tested with MikTeX~2.9
and Python~2.7.3.
\end{nota}

\begin{nota}
MikTeX is a \latex distribution that allows to download and install missing packages \emph{on the fly}. Don't forget to enable this option during the installation setup
(\reffig{fig:miktex}).
\end{nota}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{miktex}

  \label{fig:miktex}
\end{figure}

Install recommended dependencies.
\begin{itemize} 
\item Lilypond~: \url{http://lilypond.org/install/}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Modify the \command{Path} variable}

The \command{Path} variable now needs to be modified.
\begin{itemize}
\item Right-click on My Computer, then Properties.
\item In \menu{Parameters}{Advanced Settings}, click on Environment
  Variables.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{windows-path}
  \caption{Set up the \command{Path} variable.}
  \label{fig:windows-path}
\end{figure}

In the lower part (System Variables), scroll the list until the
\command{Path} command, then double-click to modify. The \command{Path}
contains a set of paths that are separated by semicolons. The
following paths must be present:
\begin{itemize}
\item Python~: \verb#C:\Python27#
\item Miktex~: \verb# C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin#
\item Lilypond~: \verb#C:\Program Files\LilyPond\usr\bin#
\end{itemize}

\begin{nota}
Pay attention to version numbers. These directories are just examples
that may need to be adapted according to your downloaded software
version.
\end{nota}

Restart your computer once your \command{Path} is modified.

\paragraph{Sources}

Sources can be retrieved as a \ext{tar.gz} archive at:
\url{http://www.patacrep.com/data/documents/songbook.tar.gz}. Its
content can be extracted with third-party softwares such as
7zip\footnote{\url{http://www.7-zip.org/}} or
Winrar\footnote{\url{http://www.win-rar.com/}}.

Alternatively, in the case you have installed a
\href{http://git-scm.com/}{Git} client, for instance
\href{http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/}{Mysysgit}, you can
download the sources with:

\begin{unix}
  git clone git://git.lohrun.net/songbook.git
\end{unix}

\paragraph{Compile and run}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the command prompt~: \Key{Windows}+\Key{r}, enter
  \command{cmd} and validate with \Key{Enter}
  (\reffig{fig:terminal-windows-a}).
\item Go to the songbook directory using \command{cd}.
For instance,
  \begin{unix}
    cd C:\
    cd songbook
  \end{unix}
\item Use the file \file{make.bat}, giving a \ext{sb} file as parameter (without extension).
  For instance,
  \begin{unix}
    windows\make.bat songbook
  \end{unix}
  produces the file \file{songbook.pdf} corresponding to \file{books/songbook.sb}.

\end{enumerate}

%*******************************************************************************
\section{Start a new songbook}
\label{sec:create-songbook}
%*******************************************************************************

In order to build a songbook, a \ext{sb} file is required whose
content is detailed in the following. A songbook file (\ext{sb})
contains a set of values for the options that are provided by a
template and a list of songs.  A \ext{sb} file must be saved into the
\directory{./books} directory. Following is an example of a songbook
file based on the minimal template and containing two songs.

\begin{code}
{
"template" : "minimal.tmpl",
"bookoptions" : [
    "diagram",
    "lilypond",
    "pictures"
  ],
"songs" : [
    "le_donjon_de_naheulbeuk/10_sous_dans_ma_poche.sg",
    "le_donjon_de_naheulbeuk/bugger_off.sg"
  ]
}
\end{code}

Available options are defined in the template file. In this case, the
value \emph{["diagram", "lilypond", "pictures"]} has been set for the
option \emph{bookoptions} of the \file{minimal.tmpl} template.
Using the \file{patacrep.tmpl} template, the following options are available:

\begin{center}
  \rowcolors{1}{white}{Aluminium1}

%*******************************************************************************
\section{Writing a song}
\label{sec:write-song}
%*******************************************************************************

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Main elements}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A song is a plain text file \file{song.sg} that is saved in a
\directory{songs/Artist} directory. Remember that filenames do not
accept spaces (replace them with underscores). A \ext{sg} file header
is composed of the following elements~:

\begin{song}
\beginsong{Title}
  [by=<Artist>,cov=<album-cover>,album=<Album>]
\end{song}

The \command{Title}, \command{Artist}, \command{album-cover} and
\command{Album} parameters must be set for each new song. The field
\command{album-cover} denotes a file \file{album-cover.jpg} that is in
the same directory of the corresponding \ext{sg} song. 

A song is a sequence of verses and chorus. A verse is written whitin a
\command{verse} environment, ie beginning with \verb|\begin{verse}|
and ending with \verb|\end{verse}|. Similarly, a chorus is written
whitin a \command{chorus} environment. Lyrics are written in plain
text within an environment.

To insert a guitar chord in the text, a special command is used. For
instance, the \latexcom{[E]} command will print the chord \command{E}
above the following syllable in the pdf.

\begin{song}
\begin{verse}
  His \[Dm]steely skin is covered
  By \[F]centuries of dust
  \[C]Once he was a great one
  \[Dm]Now he's dull and rust
\end{verse}
\end{song}

A song ends with the macro \latexcom{endsong}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Style guidelines}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A large set of rules can be automatically verified thanks to the
script \file{utils/rules.py}. For instance, this script can verify trailing spaces at the end of lines, a few punctuation rules depending on the language of the song, common spellchecking mistakes etc. Simply run the following command once your song is written:

\begin{unix}
python utils/rules.py
\end{unix}

\paragraph{Chords notation}
Chords follow the British/American notation (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). By
default, the chord is major (C refers to C major). Minor chords are
written with a lower-case \command{m}. The flat symbol ($\flat$) is
obtained with the symbol \command{\&}. The sharp symbol ($\sharp$) is
obtained with the character \command{\#}. For example, the
\command{A flat minor} chord is written \latexcom{[A\&m]}.

\begin{nota}
  For technical reasons, the symbol \command{\#} cannot be used within
  \latexcom{nolyrics} environments. In this case, you may use
  \latexcom{shrp}.
\end{nota}

\paragraph{Repeating chords}
In order to maintain an easy to read and compact document, chords in
verse and chorus are only specified once. This may be harder to
decipher the first time but in the end, the text is much more easier
to read and that's a lot less of pages to print.

However, if you want to display the chords in every verse, you should
use the \command{repeatchords} option in your template (see section
\ref{sec:create-songbook}). Note that for the moment, many songs do
not support this option as they are still incomplete.

\paragraph{Typography}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each line begins with a capital letter;
  \item No punctuation (except ``! or ?'') at the end of lines;
  \item Symbols such as {\og}; : ! ?{\fg} require an unbreakable space
    before in French but not in English~;
  \item French capital letters are accentuated (e.g {\og}À bientôt{\fg}
    and not {\og}A bientôt{\fg}).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Verse numbering and line breaks}
The numbering is automatically performed and increased with each new
\latexcom{beginverse} environment. However, it is often convenient to
decompose a same verse in two parts, without numbering the second
part. To achieve this, use the \latexcom{beginverse*} macro. For
instance, a verse composed of eight verses (lines) may usually be
decomposed in two verses of four lines. For example:

\begin{song}
\begin{verse}
  His \[Dm]steely skin is covered
  By \[F]centuries of dust
  \[C]Once he was a great one
  \[Dm]Now he's dull and rust
\end{verse}

\begin{verse*}
  An oily tear he's crying
  Can you feel the pain
  Of the sad, sad robot
  And it's driving him insane
\end{verse*}
\end{song}

\paragraph{Columns layout}
The macro \latexcom{songcolumns} determines the number of columns of
the song in the final pdf. Use this macro right before the
\latexcom{beginsong} command. Usually, a song is presented on 1, 2 or
3 columns. By default, specify two columns.

\begin{song}
\songcolumns{2}
\beginsong{Title}
\end{song}

\paragraph{Special characters}
A few characters must be written according to \LaTeX{} commands for a
better rendering in the pdf. For example, ellipsises should be written
by the command \latexcom{dots}. See also \refsec{sec:utils}.

\paragraph{Echo and repeat}
When a sentence is repeated several times, use the command
\latexcom{rep} instead of writing \emph{bis} or (x4). For example, if the
word \emph{Hallelujah} is repeated four times, write:

\begin{song}
Hallelujah \rep{4}
\end{song}

The command \latexcom{echo} refers to choirs or alike.

\begin{song}
Hallelujah \echo{Hallelujah}
\end{song}

\paragraph{Chords diagrams}
Given that the same guitar chord may be played differently and that
one position may be better than another, the songbook allows to
represent the chord as a diagram at the beginning of the song through
the command \latexcom{gtab}, right before the first verse of the
song. Following are a few examples:

\begin{song}
\gtab{C}{3:002220}
\gtab{D}{XX0232}
\gtab{E}{022100}
\gtab{Am}{X02210}
\end{song}

\begin{nota}
  X is the capital letter x. The lower-case variant is not supported.
  
  0 is the figure zero and not the capital letter O.
\end{nota}

\begin{itemize}
\item the six figures correspond to the six guitar strings
  (\chord{E}, \chord{A}, \chord{D}, \chord{G},
  \chord{B}, \chord{E})~;
\item the value indicates the fret to be played;
\item 0 denotes an open string;
\item X indicates that the string should not be played;
\item a value before ``:'' denotes a barre (\emph{3:} denotes a barre chord on third fret).
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Lilypond music sheets}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to add a melodic pattern in a song, you may use Lilypond
syntax to write the score. In this regard, open a new file
\file{score.ly} in the repertory \directory{songbook/lilypond}.
Import the file \file{header} at the beginning of your file and define
the option \command{paper-height} to ensure that the pdf score fits
one single page with minimum whitespace. A first approach is to count
1.6\,cm for a single line. Then, write your score between brackets
(see~\reffig{fig:lilypond}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FIGURE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}
  \begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{lilypond}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
  \end{minipage}

  \begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}
\begin{lilypond}
\include "header" 
\paper{paper-height = 3.3\cm} 
{
  \key c \major 
  \time 2/4

}
\end{lilypond}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{Source code for a Lilypond music sheet.}
  \label{fig:lilypond}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Finally, your file \file{sheet.ly} can be inserted in a song \ext{sg} through
the \latexcom{lilypond} command:

\begin{song}
\lilypond{sheet}
\end{song}
